<p className="mb-3">
  I graduated from <span className="font-medium">ESGI</span> with a degree in
  <span className="font-medium"> Ing√©nierie du Web </span> and have been building websites ever since.
</p>

<p>
  I work on both front-end and back-end, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Next.js to create 
  fast and user-friendly sites. 

  I keep learning new technologies to improve my skills and always focus on making websites that 
  look good and work well. I also enjoy working with clients to bring their ideas to life.
